# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# Greeting.create(message: 'Hello everyone.')
# Greeting.create(message: 'It\'s nice to see you.')
# Greeting.create(message: 'Welcome.')
# Greeting.create(message: 'Hi!')
# Greeting.create(message: 'Guten Tag.')
